## Test files
**Note that no test files are provided by the project.*(

If you have your own test files the automated tests expect the files to be stored in sub directories of:
```
tests/input/
```

Every sub directory is considered a test set, e.g. the basic test set would be the directory:
```
tests/input/basic
```
