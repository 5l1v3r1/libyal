== Detecting memory leakage ==
The tests can also be run with valgrind to detect memory leakage.

*Running the automated tests with valgrind will significantly impact the speed at which they are run.*

To run the automated tests with valgrind:
{{{
export CHECK_WITH_VALGRIND=1; make check; export CHECK_WITH_VALGRIND=;
}}}

If the automated test process detects memory leaks it will end the specific test and indicate it failed.
