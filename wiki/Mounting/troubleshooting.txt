First of all make sure to check the output of configure.
If you're seeing something like the following output configure was unable to detect an usable fuse.
{{{
Building:
   ...
   FUSE support:                                    no
}}}

On Mac OS X:
  * make sure that you only have OSXFuse installed and not another variant, like !MacFuse, besides it.
  * try adding the C pre processor flags that set the fuse API version, e.g.

{{{
CPPFLAGS=-DFUSE_USE_VERSION=26 ./configure
}}}
  * if all else fails; file a support issue and attach config.log

On Ubuntu:
{{{
fusermount – failed to open /etc/fuse.conf – Permission denied
}}}

Make sure you're part of the group fuse:
{{{
sudo addgroup <username> fuse
}}}

If fusermount keeps complaining it cannot open fuse.conf:
{{{
sudo chmod o+r /etc/fuse.conf
}}}
