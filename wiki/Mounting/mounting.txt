= Introduction =
To mount ${mount_tool_source_description} you can use ${mount_tool_name}.

There is support for the following back-ends:
${mount_tool_supported_backends}
To build ${mount_tool_name} see [Building].

= Mounting =
To mount ${mount_tool_source_description}:
{{{
${mount_tool_name} ${mount_tool_source} ${mount_tool_mount_point}
}}}

This will expose ${mount_tool_mounted_description}.
{{{
${mount_tool_mounted_fuse}
}}}

If you get the error:
{{{
${mount_tool_missing_backend_error}
}}}

That means fuse was not detected when building the ${tools_name}, check if you have fuse-dev installed and if ./configure is able to detect it.
The last part of the ./configure output shows you this in an overview.
