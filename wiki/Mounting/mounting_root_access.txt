== Why is ${mount_tool_mount_point} not accessible as root ==
By default fuse prevents root access to the mount point when ${mount_tool_source_description} is mounted.
To enable this functionality first check the fuse documentation.

Make sure the fuse configuration file:
{{{
/etc/fuse.conf
}}}

Contains:
{{{
user_allow_other
}}}

Pass "allow_root" to the fuse sub system using the ${mount_tool_name} -X option:
{{{
${mount_tool_name} -X allow_root ${mount_tool_source} ${mount_tool_mount_point}
}}}
