To mount ${mount_tool_source_description} you can either:
  * mount it directly from a device file;
  * mount it directly our of a RAW storage media image at a certain offset.

To mount directly from a device file:
{{{
${mount_tool_name} /dev/sda2 ${mount_tool_mount_point}
}}}

To mount directly our of a RAW storage media image at a certain offset:
{{{
${mount_tool_name} -o 524288 ${mount_tool_source} ${mount_tool_mount_point}
}}}

Note that ${mount_tool_name} takes an offset in bytes if you're copying the output from mmls multiply by the sector size:
{{{
${mount_tool_name} -o $$(( 1024 * 512 )) ${mount_tool_source} ${mount_tool_mount_point}
}}}

This will expose ${mount_tool_mounted_description}.
{{{
${mount_tool_mounted_fuse}
}}}
