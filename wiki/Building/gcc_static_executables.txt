## Static executables
Some distributions provide separate packages for static versions of libraries. Make sure you have a static versions of:
* glibc
${gcc_static_build_dependencies}

To make static executables add --enable-static-executables=yes to configure, .e.g:
```
./configure --enable-static-executables=yes
```
