== Mac OS X universal binary ==
With XCode you can build a Mac OS X universal binary to run on multiple architectures. The supported architectures and exact command differs per version of Mac OS X.

=== Mac OS X 10.4 ===
E.g. on Mac OS X 10.4 to build an PPC and Intel 32-bit multi binary, run the following commands:
{{{
CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch ppc -arch i386" \
./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
make
make install
}}}

=== Mac OS X 10.6 ===
E.g. on Mac OS X 10.6 to build an Intel 32-bit and 64-bit multi binary, run the following commands:
{{{
CFLAGS="-isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -arch x86_64 -arch i386" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk -arch x86_64 -arch i386" \
./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
make
make install
}}}

=== Mac OS X 10.7 ===
E.g. on Mac OS X 10.7 to build an Intel 32-bit and 64-bit multi binary, run the following commands:
{{{
CFLAGS="-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk -arch x86_64 -arch i386" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk -arch x86_64 -arch i386" \
./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
make
make install
}}}

=== Mac OS X ===
Mac OS X comes with multiple platform specific build Python versions. If you install a different version of Python on Mac OS X make sure that when building and running the Python-bindings you're using the correct version otherwise it will likely result in one of the following errors:
{{{
Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
}}}

{{{
Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
}}}

To build against a specific version you can tell configure where to look:
{{{
CFLAGS=-I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/ \
LDFLAGS=-L/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/ \
./configure --enable-python --with-pyprefix
}}}

Adding --with-pyprefix tells configure to use Python to determine where to install the Python-bindings.
