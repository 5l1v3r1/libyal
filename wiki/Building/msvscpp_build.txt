== Building ==
Open the file:
{{{
msvscpp\${project_name}.sln
}}}

Note that the project files contain a Release and VSDebug configuration.
The VSDebug builds the binaries with debug information.
Note that this is not the same as debug output.

Make sure to check if your build environment defines the correct WINVER for your build.
The code uses WINAPI version specific functions based on WINVER.
You can define a custom WINVER in the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ project files or in common\config_winapi.h

And build the solution. The build files will be places in:
{{{
msvscpp\Release\
}}}
