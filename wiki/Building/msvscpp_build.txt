== Building ==
Open the file:
{{{
msvscpp\${project_name}.sln
}}}

Note that the project files contain a Release and VSDebug configuration.
The VSDebug builds the binaries with debug information.
Note that this is not the same as debug output.

Make sure to check if your build environment defines the correct WINVER for your build.
The code uses WINAPI version specific functions based on WINVER.
You can define a custom WINVER in the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ project files or in common\config_winapi.h

And build the solution. The build files will be places in:
{{{
msvscpp\Release\
}}}

=== Using MSBuild ===
Another way to build ${project_name} with Visual Studio is to use MSBuild via the command line.
MSBuild can be installed as part of the Microsoft.NET Framework.

First set-up the Visual Studio variables:
{{{
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat
}}}

Next run MSBuild:
{{{
msbuild msvscpp\${project_name}.sln /p:Configuration=Release;Platform=Win32
}}}
