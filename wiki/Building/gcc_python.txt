== Python-bindings ==
To compile the Python-bindings you'll need the Python development files.

Make sure that on:
  * a Linux machine, you have python-dev (Debian-based) or python-devel (!RedHat-based) installed.
  * a Mac OS X machine, XCode if you're using a different Python source tree see Mac OS X notes below.

Adding --enable-python when running ./configure will enable the Python-bindings to be build.
{{{
./configure --enable-python
}}}
