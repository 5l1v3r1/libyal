== Git ==
To retrieve the source from the git repository make sure to install: git, aclocal, autoconf, automake, autopoint, gettextize and libtoolize.

To download and prepare the source for building run:
{{{
git clone ${git_url}
cd ${project_name}/
./synclibs.sh
./autogen.sh
}}}

*Note that the source from the git repository will not work without synchronizing the library dependencies "./synclibs.sh" and having the autotools generate the necessary files "./autogen.sh".*
