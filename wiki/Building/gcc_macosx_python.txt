=== Python-bindings ===
Mac OS X comes with multiple platform specific build Python versions. If you install a different version of Python on Mac OS X make sure that when building and running the Python-bindings you're using the correct version otherwise it will likely result in one of the following errors:
{{{
Fatal Python error: Interpreter not initialized (version mismatch?)
}}}

{{{
Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
}}}

To build against a specific version you can tell configure where to look:
{{{
CFLAGS=-I/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/ \
LDFLAGS=-L/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/ \
./configure --enable-python --with-pyprefix
}}}

Adding --with-pyprefix tells configure to use Python to determine where to install the Python-bindings.
