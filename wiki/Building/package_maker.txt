= Mac OS X package =
!PackageMaker can be used to create a Mac OS X package.

The following instructions show how to build ${project_name}.pkg and ${project_name}.dmg from the command line.
First build ${project_name} a build as a universal binary with Python-bindings, therefore add the following argument to the "./configure" statement:
{{{
--prefix=$$PWD/macosx/tmp/${package_maker_configure_options}
}}}

${package_maker_pyprefix}
After running "make install" the binaries are installed in:
{{{
$$PWD/macosx/tmp/
}}}

Before creating the ${project_name}.pkg the file permissions and ownership needs to be corrected, by running:
{{{
sudo chown -R root:wheel macosx/tmp/
}}}

To create the package (directory):
{{{
/Applications/PackageMaker.app/Contents/MacOS/PackageMaker --doc macosx/${project_name}.pmdoc --out ../${project_name}-<version>.pkg
}}}

To create a distributable disk image:
{{{
hdiutil create ../${project_name}-<version>.dmg -srcfolder ../${project_name}-<version>.pkg -fs HFS+
}}}
