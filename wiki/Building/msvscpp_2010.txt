## 64-bit with Microsoft Visual Studio express
To build a 64-bit version of ${project_name} with Microsoft Visual Studio
express you'll need at least the 2010 version.

### Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
First make sure to enabling 64-bit compilation support on Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010 express. Since this can be a tedious process, some relevant links:

* http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2519277

If you have set it up correctly the following should work:

Go to:
```
Configuration manager -> Active solution platform
```

Select "```<New>```"
* Type or select the new platform: "x64"
* Copy settings from: "Win32"
* Create new project platforms: enabled


Additionally for every project change:
```
Configuration Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset
```

Into "Windows7.1SDK"

If you've Cygwin installed on your Visual Studio build machine you can try
running one of the following scripts to add the x64 settings for you:
```
sh msvscpp/scripts/vs2008_x64.sh
```

Make sure to convert the solution first from 2008 to 2010.
```
sh msvscpp/scripts/vs2010_x64.sh
```
