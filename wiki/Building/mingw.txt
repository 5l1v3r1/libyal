= Using Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW) =
To compile ${project_name} using MinGW you'll need:
  * MinGW
${mingw_build_dependencies}

To build use:
{{{
mingw32-configure --prefix=/opt/local/i386-mingw32 --enable-winapi=yes
mingw32-make
}}}

It is recommended that you use WINAPI support but it is possible to compile ${project_name} without it (--enable-winapi=no).
The default behavior is that configure will try to auto-detect MinGW and enable WINAPI support.

If mingw32-configure and mingw32-make are not available you can build it with:
{{{
./configure --host=i386-mingw32 --prefix=/opt/local/i386-mingw32 --enable-winapi=yes
make
}}}

If this does not work try a script similar to the following:
{{{
#!/bin/sh
CC=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc
CXX=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-g++
AR=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ar
OBJDUMP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-objdump
RANLIB=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-ranlib
STRIP=/opt/local/bin/i386-mingw32-strip
MINGWFLAGS="-mwin32 -mconsole -march=i586 "
CFLAGS="$$MINGWFLAGS"
CXXFLAGS="$$MINGWFLAGS"

CC=$$CC CXX=$$CXX AR=$$AR OBJDUMP=$$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$$RANLIB STRIP=$$STRIP ./configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --prefix=/opt/local/i386-mingw32 --enable-winapi=yes
CC=$$CC CXX=$$CXX AR=$$AR OBJDUMP=$$OBJDUMP RANLIB=$$RANLIB STRIP=$$STRIP CFLAGS="$$CFLAGS" CXXFLAGS="$$CXXFLAGS" make
}}}

If you get compiler errors like:
{{{
#error WINAPI file open function for Windows 2000 or earlier NOT implemented yet
}}}

That means WINVER is not set or set to a version predating Windows XP (0x0501) and you'll have to set WINVER manually like:
{{{
CFLAGS=-DWINVER=0x0501 ./configure --host=i386-mingw32 --enable-winapi=yes
}}}

You should end up with the following DLL:
{{{
${project_name}/.libs/${mingw_dll_filename}
}}}

${mingw_executables}
To install ${project_name} and tools in the MinGW build tree use:
{{{
sudo make install
}}}

== Using the DLL ==
Make sure you use define ${project_name_upper_case}_DLL_IMPORT before including <${project_name}.h>.

${mingw_dll_dependencies}
== Troubleshooting ==
While running make I get an error similar to the following:
{{{
libclocale_locale.c: In function 'libclocal_local_get_decimal_point':
libclocale_locale.c:357:2: warning implicit declaration of function 'GetLocaleInfoEx' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
libclocale_locale.c:358:7: error: 'LOCALE_NAME_USER_DEFAULT' undeclared (first use in this function)
libclocale_locale.c:358:7: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for every function it appears in
}}}

The version of MinGW does not support a WINAPI version of Vista or later (0x0600) try setting WINVER to 0x0501.
