# Using GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)

Before you build the ${project_name} source code using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) you'll need to have compilation and build tools installed.
* On a Linux system make sure you have build-essential (Debian-based) or the Development Tools (RedHat-based) packages installed.
* On a Mac OS X system make sure you have XCode (with command line tools) or MacPorts (or equivalent) installed.

To build the ${project_name} source code change into the source directory and run the following commands:
```
./configure
make
```

You can install the binaries that were build by running:
```
sudo make install
```

By default this will install the binaries in /usr/local. If you want to change this to e.g. /usr, add the configuration option --prefix=/usr, e.g.
```
./configure --prefix=/usr
```

On Linux make sure ${project_name}.so is in the library cache. Normally it suffices to run:
```
sudo ldconfig
```
