# Troubleshooting issues
Some common tips for troubleshooting issue:
1. Check if the documentation already describes your issue;
2. Check the [issues](https://github.com/libyal/${project_name}/issues), to see if you are experiencing a known issue;
3. Make sure to use a recent version. The latest version could have introduced new bugs so try the one before that as well;
4. Report the issue via the [issues](https://github.com/libyal/${project_name}/issues) or via email. If you don't report it, it is not likely to get fixed.
