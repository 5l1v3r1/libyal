## Run-time errors
### Microsoft Visual Studio
On Windows if an executable built with Visual Studio will not run and shows you an error dialog that a certain function is not implemented:
* check that you've installed the Visual Studio run-time DLLs for the version of Visual Studio;
* check if WINVER is set correctly;
* check if your version of Visual Studio is compatible with your version of Windows, e.g. a Visual Studio 2008 created binary will not run on Windows 2000.

You can use Visual Studio's bindump.exe to determine which versions of Windows your executable has been built for.

Some examples of common run-time errors:
```
The procedure entry point DecodePointer could not be located in the dynamic link library KERNEL32.DLL
```

You are likely trying to run an executable created by Visual Studio 2010 or later on a version of Windows that is no longer supported.
