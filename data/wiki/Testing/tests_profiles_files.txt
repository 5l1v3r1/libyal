Each test profile can also define which files to run in a specific test set in the files-file, e.g. for the basic test set in the ${project_name} test profile:
```
tests/input/.${project_name}/basic/files
```

Every line of the files-file specifies the filename in the test set to include in the test.
Files not defined in the files-file are ignored by the test.

E.g. if the basic test set sub directory contains the files:
```
${tests_example_filename1}
${tests_example_filename2}
```

and only the first file needs to be tested, the files-file can then be defined as:
```
${tests_example_filename1}
```
