## Test profiles
There are also multiple test profiles:
${tests_profiles}

These test profiles are used by one or more tests.
By default the tests run all the test sets, if applicable.
Each test profile can define which test sets to ignore in the ignore-file, e.g. for the ${project_name} test profile:
```
tests/input/.${project_name}/ignore
```

Every line of the ignore-file specifies (the sub directory name of) the test set that should be ignored, e.g. for the basic test set:
```
basic
```

Some of the tests store data in the test profile to be used for comparison in successive test runs.
At the moment this data needs to be cleaned out manual if it causes the test to fail due to legitimate changes.
