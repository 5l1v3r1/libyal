## Why is /mnt/fuse not accessible as root
By default fuse prevents root access to the mount point when ${mount_tool_source_description} is mounted.
To enable this functionality first check the fuse documentation.

Make sure the fuse configuration file:
```
/etc/fuse.conf
```

Contains:
```
user_allow_other
```

Pass "allow_root" to the fuse sub system using the ${mount_tool_name} -X option:
```
${mount_tool_name} -X allow_root${mount_tool_additional_arguments} ${mount_tool_source} /mnt/fuse
```
