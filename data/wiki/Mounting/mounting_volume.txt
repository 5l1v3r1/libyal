# Mounting
To mount ${mount_tool_source_description} you can either:

* mount it directly from a device file;
* mount it directly our of a RAW storage media image at a certain offset.

To mount directly from a device file:
```
${mount_tool_name}${mount_tool_additional_arguments} /dev/sda2 /mnt/fuse
```

To mount directly our of a RAW storage media image at a certain offset:
```
${mount_tool_name}${mount_tool_additional_arguments} -o 524288 ${mount_tool_source} /mnt/fuse
```

Note that ${mount_tool_name} takes an offset in bytes if you're copying the output from mmls multiply by the sector size:
```
${mount_tool_name}${mount_tool_additional_arguments} -o $$(( 1024 * 512 )) ${mount_tool_source} /mnt/fuse
```

This will expose ${mount_tool_mounted_description}.
```
/mnt/fuse/${project_name_suffix}1
```
