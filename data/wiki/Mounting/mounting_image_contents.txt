If your operating system supports loop devices, such as Linux, mount can be used
to mount the device file as a loop device:
```
mount -o loop,ro,offset=$${OFFSET} /mnt/fuse/${project_name_suffix}1 /mnt/file_system
```

Make sure to define $${OFFSET} to contan the byte offset, relative to the start
of the device file, of the start of the file system.

On Mac OS hdiutil can be used to mount the device file:
```
hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount /mnt/fuse/${project_name_suffix}1
```
