If your operating system supports loop devices, such as Linux, mount can be used
to mount the device file as a loop device:
```
mount -o loop,ro /mnt/fuse/${project_name_suffix}1 /mnt/file_system
```

On Mac OS hdiutil can be used to mount the device file:
```
hdiutil attach -imagekey diskimage-class=CRawDiskImage -nomount /mnt/fuse/${project_name_suffix}1
```
