## Static executables
Some distributions provide separate packages for static versions of libraries. Make sure you have a static versions of:

* glibc
${gcc_static_build_dependencies}

To make static executables add --enable-static-executables=yes to configure, .e.g:
```
./configure --enable-static-executables=yes
```

Check if the executables can be run.

Disable multi-thread support with `--enable-multi-threading-support=no` if you get an error similar to:
```
libcthreads_read_write_lock_grab_for_write: unable to lock read/write lock for write with error: Deadlock condition detected.
```
