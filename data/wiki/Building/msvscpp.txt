# Using Microsoft Visual Studio
Before you build ${project_name} using Microsoft Visual Studio you'll need to have it installed.
The ${project_name} packages comes with Microsoft Visual Studio files for version 2008.
Version 2010 is able to convert these files into its newer versions.

The Microsoft Visual Studio express version is sufficient.
Note that if you want to build 64-bit version with the express version you'll need at least 2010.
Also see the section: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 express and 64-bit compilation.
