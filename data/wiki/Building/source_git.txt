## Git
**Note that the git repository holds the development version of the source code.**

**If you are not developing it is recommended that you download a source distribution package instead.**

To retrieve the source from the git repository make sure to install:

* git
* aclocal
* autoconf
* automake
* autopoint or gettextize
* libtoolize
* pkg-config
${build_dependencies}

To download and prepare the source for building run:
```
git clone ${project_git_url}
cd ${project_name}/
./synclibs.sh
./autogen.sh
```

The source from the git repository will not work without synchronizing the library dependencies "./synclibs.sh" and having the autotools generate the necessary files "./autogen.sh".

### Mac OS X
On Mac OS X the XCode command line tools no longer provide the autotools you can obtain them e.g. via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).
Install the following packages:
```
sudo port install autoconf automake gettext libtool pkgconfig
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio
Since Microsoft Visual Studio does not come with a Unix shell or equivalent you'll need to use the Windows PowerShell scripts instead:
```
git clone ${project_git_url}
cd ${project_name}\
.\synclibs.ps1
.\autogen.ps1
```

Check "appveyor.yml" to make sure there are additional PowerShell scripts you need to run.
