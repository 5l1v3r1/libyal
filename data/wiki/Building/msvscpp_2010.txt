## 64-bit with Microsoft Visual Studio express
To build a 64-bit version of ${project_name} with Microsoft Visual Studio
express you'll need at least the 2010 version.

### Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
First make sure to enabling 64-bit compilation support on Microsoft Visual
Studio 2010 express. Since this can be a tedious process, some relevant links:

* http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/9yb4317s(v=vs.100).aspx
* http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2519277

If you have set it up correctly the following should work:

Go to:
```
Configuration manager -> Active solution platform
```

Select "```<New>```"

* Type or select the new platform: "x64"
* Copy settings from: "Win32"
* Create new project platforms: enabled

Additionally for every project change:
```
Configuration Properties -> General -> Platform Toolset
```

Into "Windows7.1SDK"

If you've Python installed on your Visual Studio build machine you can try
running [msvscpp-convert](https://github.com/libyal/libyal/wiki/msvscpp-convert)
to convert the Visual Studio 2008 solution files to 2010 format and add the x64
settings for you.

```
msvscpp-convert.py --to 2010 msvscpp\libcstring.sln
```

This will create a subdirectory named vs2010 which contains the Visual Studio
2010 solution files.
