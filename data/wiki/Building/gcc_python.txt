## Python-bindings
To compile the Python-bindings you'll need the Python development files.

Make sure that on:

* a Linux machine, you have python-dev (Debian-based) or python-devel (RedHat-based) installed.
* a macOS machine, XCode if you're using a different Python source tree see macOS notes below.

Adding --enable-python when running ./configure will enable the Python-bindings to be build.
```
./configure --enable-python
```
