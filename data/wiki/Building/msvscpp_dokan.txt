## Dokan library
Note that currently ${project_name} only supports Dokan 0.6.0. There is work in progress to support later versions of Dokan.

Get the Dokan installation from: https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany/releases/tag/0.6.0 and install the driver.

Get the source including patches.
```
git clone https://github.com/joachimmetz/dokan
```

The Visual Studio project files expect the source directory to be named dokan and located in the directory containing the ${project_name}-```<version>``` directory.

The Dokan library is now ready to be build from the ${project_name} Visual Studio solution file and will be named dokan.dll.
